✨ Notes

This repo is only for the portfolio page (deyno-dev.github.io).

Project-specific sites live in their own repos (mediax, mediax.gallery, etc.).

Pages are deployed automatically from the main branch.

Do you want me to also prepare a **LICENSE file** (MIT/Apache dual like your other repos) so the portfolio repo is consistent with the rest of your GitHub?
